# MovieRevenuePrediction

### Introduction

In this project, we are taking on the role of the Data Science Team of a movie production company. We want to predict if a movie will be profitable, given a variety of factors: popularity of actors, budget, country of production, etc.


Production companies are responsible for funding movies which they believe will return a profit.  This decision is discretionary, which leads to potential risks of human error and bias.  In order to minimize risk and remove the possibility of human error when it comes to assessing potential profitability of a proposed movie, we constructed a model designed to analyse the features of a proposed movie and assess its potential profitability.


The data for this project is collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), source - Kaggle. The data is in two CSV files. The main dataset contains 5000 movies and 20 columns, while the second file contains information on movie cast and credits. The process of observing the dataset, manipulating it, and building a predictive model is described in the slides.
